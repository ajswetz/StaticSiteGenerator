Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `code`.

Itemized lists look like:

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item


Here's a code block:

```
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
```

### An h3 header ###

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (includingthat last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar) and another to a [localdoc](local-doc.html).
